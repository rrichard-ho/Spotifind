# Spotifind - a Spotify recommendation app

## Functionalities

- Takes a seed track to generate a playlist of 30 similar songs
- Includes the option to export the playlist to the user's Spotify library

**Note**: Need to generate a new `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` from the Spotify app dashboard in order to use. Remember to add `http://127.0.0.1:5000/redirect` as the redirect URL.
